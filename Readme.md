## ReactAPP
1. Basic React App, Where I'm Printing "Hello world on the main screen"
2. I have writen this react code using CDN react-Development package, Where I have imported React-Core and React-DOM
3. I have created a react Object using react code, and I have also created a root element using React-DOM, Where this root.Render operation converts this object into HTML.
4. React is Library! Not a FrameWork. 
5. React can even be used at small parts of the application that we are trying to create now or already existing one.
6. This code is not production ready. 
7. Created react app without using create react app Command!
8. JSX is not React. Even the largescale applications can be build by using react. But the JSX makes developers    life easy.
9. Created Scripts --> start and build!
10. Created a .gitignore, as i dont want to push the node_modules, Parcel-cache and dist.
