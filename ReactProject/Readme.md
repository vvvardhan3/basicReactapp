## ReactAPP
1. Basic React App, Where I'm Printing "Hello world on the main screen"
2. I have writen this react code using CDN react-Development package, Where I have imported React-Core and React-DOM
3. I have created a react Object using react code, and I have also created a root element using React-DOM, Where this root.Render operation converts this object into HTML.
4. React is Library! Not a FrameWork. 
5. React can even be used at small parts of the application that we are trying to create now or already existing one.
6. This code is not production ready.
